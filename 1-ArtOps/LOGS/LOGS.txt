Experiment: White Point Project Experiments in Infinitesimal Pink

Statement of Purpose: Trying to study how light pink acrylic paint dries on cardboard.

Procedure: I watered down some pinkish paint and painted it on the cardboard sample. I let it dry standing up so that the paint would run. I am studying to see how it dries. I will add a thin layer of even more infinitesimally pink acrylic washes.

Notes: So far so good. Not much to say.

Experiment: White Point Project, Deconstruction of Pink and Yellow In Daylight Series

Statement of Purpose: Adding incremental very thin layers of infinitesimally white colors to originally Infinitesimal Pink

Procedure: I added infinitesimal yellow. The pink had already darkened, added to the color of the cardboard, I suppose, which is light brown. Added yellow-white wash, very thin, watered down. Observing results. Drying standing up again, but upside down this time to not show too much orientation information when displaying or scanning, digitally visualizing painting.

Notes: It's not so bad. The pinkish hue darkened when it dried, this surprised me. The yellow-white wash will have almost no visual effect on the production piece. It will just give it a soft "chalk" feel.

Experiment: WHITEPOINT PROJECT: Incremental Offwhite Series

Statement of Purpose: Introducing Pinkish White Wash, Then Yellow-White, Then Blueish-White Wash, in thin liquid layers, the washes add up to a Series, in theory the Daylight Series, since those are the hues I am using.

Procedure: Decompose the Daylight Series. Take hues from there, add them in thin layers to generate/compose COMPLEX COLORS.. Study the effects of the paint drying on the cardboard... Does the cardboard begin to behave differently after many watery layers?

Notes: I now have three layers and it is almost perfectly WHITE... infinitesimally OFFWHITE, which is the whole point of the WHITEPOINT PROJECT. So so far, in three layers, it is an ultimate success!

Experiment: Continuing Whitepoint Project Innovations Experiments, Innovations in Color Work, Moral Temperature Cards

Statement of Purpose: Taking the experiment further, I started two more pieces of cardboard. I painted them with very thin layers of colors imitating the color of your average piece of cardboard, slight moca.

Procedure: I ended up escalating the gradients a little, nearing towards a kind of patina corrosive chemical process, a light green reminiscent of patina on bronze. I left it and have been studying the visual color artifacts, from various lighting situations, perspectives, movements of the eye, etc.

Notes: I'm not doing too bad. Not too shabby. We will have to see where this Whitepoint Series goes... we have two pieces of cardboard.. and we've done some other color work to go with it. But pearly offwhites of old antique wood veneer coincided nicely with the light green hues of patina on bronze... on old pennies....

Experiment: Same Whitepoint Experimental Series/Collection

Statement of Purpose: Additional layers on two separate pieces of cardboard.

Procedure: I ended up having to "subdue" the hues of the cardboard piece. I put the paint on a little thicker at times. It took away the natural "Moir√©" effect of the corrugated cardboard when it moistens enough. With thicker acrylic paint, I more or less prime the canvas. These are all experiments part of the Priming Module in the Art Operations Manual.

Notes: I studied it under early morning sunlight and didn't like it. The colors were not even, meaning there were zones of visibly different colors amongst single cardboard surfaces. I will add a very thin wash of almost not pigment, white pigment, minimalistic. They look blueish in the day outside in early morning January 1st, 2017. Indoors they get more yellow.

Experiment: White Point Project/Series, Starting With Infinitessimal offwite, Yellow Series

Statement of Purpose: Starting a series of four paintings, canvases each 6 inches by 8 inches. Primed them offwhite yellow. Very close to white, infinitesimal offwhite.

Procedure: I liquefied a bit of acrylic paint, a mixture of white and yellow, largely white. I primed the four canvases. As I told Michael, I am also experimenting with different angles of drying as well as temperatures. I spoke of "cooking" the paint. It's a jargon I use that doesn't really mean anything, except a hint at Rembrandt. Eyes Only material.

Notes: So I am cooking the paint in different conditions, environments.. in the lab. Not literally cooking, and it's not secret, really. It's just the acrylic behaves differently in its drying depending on many factors. It dries fast and sometimes that is a good thing, sometimes that is a bad thing. It dries fast in an apartment heated in the winter, when you paint by the heater, is one example. It can dry so fast that it literally bakes on the canvas, making these textures reminiscent of the skin of portraits by Rembrant. You can "cook" acrylic to look like real skin... it's pretty amazing.

Experiment: White Point Series/Project Continued, 4-tuple priming job

Statement of Purpose: Trying to get a really effective offwhite color for these canvasses, as primary "priming" job.

Procedure: So far, I have painted them all offwhite, but they were too yellow still to my taste so I sanded them down, repainted them with very watery white wash, then sanded, and repeated the process a second time. Now they are cleaned and awaiting further study. They were also dried differently.

Notes: The results so far are "okay". Not ideal. It's going to take some tinkering. I don't like the yellow, it's still too yellow, it needs some ochre in there, or a touch of sienna. Maybe an infinitesimally micro-pink wash will do the trick. It's a risk I am willing to take.
